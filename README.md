Internship Assignments Repository

Welcome to the repository containing assignments and projects I completed during my undergraduate years (Year 1 to Year 3). This repository showcases my programming skills across various languages, including C, Java, and Python, and covers diverse problem-solving scenarios and system implementations. Below is an overview of the assignments, their descriptions, and the skills demonstrated.

Assignment 1: Recursive Chess Puzzle Solver

	•	Language: Python
	•	Description: Developed a recursive algorithm to solve a chess puzzle by finding the optimal sequence of moves leading to a checkmate. The program considers the constraints imposed by the opponent’s moves provided in a file.
 
	•	Highlights:
	•	Parsing and visualizing chessboards.
	•	Recursive solution finding with game constraints.
	•	Chess piece movement logic (excluding advanced moves like en passant or castling).
 
	•	Key Files:
	•	ex_board1.txt, ex_board2.txt (Sample chessboards)
	•	ex_opponent1.txt, ex_opponent2.txt (Opponent moves)

Assignment 2: Radegast’s Terrain Modification Game

	•	Language: Java
	•	Description: Created a terrain modification and analysis game involving height adjustments, flooding simulations, and connected area identification.
	•	Highlights:
	•	Interactive modification of a 2D terrain matrix.
	•	Calculation and labeling of “money lakes” formed after flooding.
	•	Accurate computation of lake volumes and final scores.
 
	•	Key Features:
	•	Command-line interface for input and modifications.
	•	Alphabetical notation for rows, columns, and lakes.
	•	Robust error handling for invalid inputs.

Assignment 3: Lahmacun Shop Management System

	•	Language: Java
	•	Description: Designed a management system for a fictional lahmacun restaurant chain to simulate employee promotions, dismissals, hiring, and bonuses based on performance metrics.
 
	•	Highlights:
	•	Hierarchical promotion system.
	•	Dynamic handling of employee turnovers.
	•	Accurate calculation of bonuses and penalties based on monthly scores.
 
	•	Key Features:
	•	Branch-level management and performance tracking.
	•	Input-output operations to process monthly updates.

Assignment 4: Minesweeper Game

	•	Language: Java
	•	Description: Developed a playable version of the classic Minesweeper game with configurable grid sizes, mine counts, and additional hint functionality.
 
	•	Highlights:
	•	Recursive revealing of cells with no neighboring mines.
	•	Dynamic mine distribution for replayability.
	•	Winning and losing conditions with user notifications.
 
	•	Key Features:
	•	Configurable grid size and mine density.
	•	Hint system to identify safe moves based on game state.

Assignment 5: Farm Environment Simulation

	•	Language: Prolog
	•	Description: Built a simulation for a farm environment where animals interact with food objects, move, and reproduce based on energy points.
 
	•	Highlights:
	•	Implemented movement logic for different agents (cows, chickens, wolves).
	•	Calculated Manhattan distances and managed farm value based on animals and food.
	•	Recursive action sequences for consumption and reproduction.
 
	•	Key Features:
	•	Comprehensive predicates for agent actions and state updates.
	•	Debugging and visualization for farm states.

Assignment 6: Virtual Video Game Console

	•	Language: C, Shell Scripting
	•	Description: Created a virtual video game console with three standalone C games and a console interface for game selection.
 
	•	Highlights:
	•	Implemented “Snake” as a mandatory game and two additional interactive games.
	•	Developed a main menu interface for selecting and launching games.
	•	Used virtual disks formatted as ext4 for plug-and-play functionality.
 
	•	Key Features:
	•	Smooth game exits using signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM).
	•	Predefined screen resolution for game display.
	•	Dynamic loading of game executables from a virtual disk.
